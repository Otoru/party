Paraty brings together a series of Golang codes to work with VoIP.

## Whats is VoIP?

VoIP stands for Voice over Internet Protocol, which is a technology that enables the transmission of voice and other forms of communication over the internet using IP networks. VoIP works by converting analog voice signals into digital data packets, which are then transmitted over the internet to the recipient's device where they are converted back into analog signals. This allows users to make voice calls using the internet rather than traditional telephone networks, resulting in lower costs and increased flexibility. VoIP is widely used in business and consumer applications, such as video conferencing, instant messaging, and other forms of unified communications.

## Install

To install the lib use the following command:
